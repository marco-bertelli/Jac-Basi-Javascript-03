# Greed Dice Game
Greed is a dice game played with five six-sided dice. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to score a throw according to these rules. You will always be given an array with five six-sided dice values.
A single die can only be counted once in each roll. For example, a given "5" can only count as part of a triplet (contributing to the 500 points) or as a single 50 points, but not both in the same roll.
